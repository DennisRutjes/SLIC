# SLIC

An implementation of the SLIC (simple linear iterative clustering) superpixel generation algorithm

> Superpixel algorithms group pixels into perceptually meaningful atomic regions, which can be used to replace the rigid structure of the pixel grid. They capture image redundancy, provide a convenient primitive from which to compute image features, and greatly reduce the complexity of subsequent image processing tasks. They have become key building blocks of many computer vision algorithms, such as multi-class object segmentation, depth estimation, segmentation, body model estimation, and object localization.
